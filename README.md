# Tide  Times Application Created by Cursor AI and Xcode

## Description

 I follow video [I Made an iOS App in MINUTES with This AI Tool!‚Äù ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe3Jn6FRoII) 

 App take information from https://www.worldtides.info/. 

Access to the tide information requires an API key and the first 100 requests are free, then you need a paid subscription.

I use  only Composer of Cursor AI, which works with the entire project.
